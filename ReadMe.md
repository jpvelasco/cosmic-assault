## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari recommended)
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- AWS CLI (configured with appropriate permissions)
- AWS Account

### Setup and Deployment

These steps cover cloning the repository, installing dependencies, building the infrastructure code, and deploying the stack to AWS.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jpvelasco/cosmic-assault
    cd cosmic-assault
    ```

2.  **Navigate to Infrastructure Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd infrastructure
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Node.js packages for the CDK project.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Build Infrastructure Code:** Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript. This is necessary before running any CDK commands.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **(Optional) Configure AWS Credentials:** Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary permissions if you haven't already.
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

6.  **Deploy to AWS:** Deploy the infrastructure stack (S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution) and the website content.
    ```bash
    cdk deploy
    ```

    *Note: You might be prompted to approve IAM policy changes during the first deployment.*
    *After deployment, the CloudFront distribution URL will be displayed as an output.*

This deployment process will:
- Create the necessary AWS infrastructure (S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, etc.).
- Upload the static website files from the `../website` directory to the S3 bucket.
- Configure the CloudFront distribution to serve the website.
